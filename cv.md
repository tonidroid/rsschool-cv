1. In 2020, I took third place at the regional stage of WorldSkills. In competence "Software solutions for business".
I began to study Java with Shildtâ€™s book, Java 8. A Complete Guide. Now I'm studying android, switching to kotlin. There are 3 small projects on github. A huge desire to get real practical knowledge. Therefore, enrolled in the RS School. At this stage I want to delve deeper into android, to understand more subtleties. I just want to understand how it all works. I really like it.
